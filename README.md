Your task is to create onepage application with list of clients and their details using React 
(https://reactjs.org/) and Semantic-UI framework (https://semantic-ui.com/). Clients data are 
stored in 'clients.json' which will be loaded dynamicaly via XHR.

wireframe description

clients list
Every item will display smaller avatar (in  json there is only one avatar size, so feel free to resize it). Next to 
the avatar there will be clients name and job title. When user clicks on an item, it will display client's 
details on the right.

search
Above this list there will be search bar. It will search all informations, not only those showed in the clients 
list. Results will be displayed instead of list of clients and they will show instantly as user starts to type.

client's details
Pretty self-explanatory, on the left there will be full size avatar (128x128px), next to it big clients name, 
smaller job title and company name ("{job.title} - {job.company}") below this name. Next there will be all 
other clients informations like address, and contact informations.

requirements
use Redux (any implementation) for data management
work inside git repository (commit changes as much as possible)

will be a plus
using Reselect (https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
100% unit tests coverage
